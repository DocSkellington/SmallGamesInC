/**
 * The Bindings struct handles the bindings between an \ref Action and a
 * SDL_Scancode.
 *
 * Use \ref Bindings_Create to create a new bindings manager, which can be
 * populated via \ref Bindings_Set and \ref Bindings_Add. The function \ref
 * Bindings_Remove removes one binding, while \ref Bindings_Clear removes every
 * scancode associated to an action.
 *
 * To test if a binding exists for an action, use \ref Bindings_Has, and \ref
 * Bindings_Matches to check whether a given scancode matches the bindings of
 * the action. To get every defined binding, call \ref Bindings_Get.
 *
 * It is also possible to define aliases: if <code>Bindings_SetAlias(bindings,
 * a, b)</code> is called, then any scancode that matches <code>b</code> will
 * also match <code>a</code>. Use \ref Bindings_SetAlias, \ref
 * Bindings_AddAlias, \ref Bindings_RemoveAlias and \ref Bindings_ClearAlias to
 * manipulate the aliases.
 *
 * \ref Bindings_Get does not return, nor "expand" the aliases, i.e., the
 * function only returns the proper key bindings.
 *
 * \warning Controllers and mouse controls are not supported.
